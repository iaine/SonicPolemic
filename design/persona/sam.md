## Sam

Sam is a media student who wants to review a recent
conference using SonicPolemic. They would consider
themselves a less advanced user. 

They want to listen to the sonifications of the 
timeline for a particular project. 

As part of this, they want to be able to identify
the places where the Tweeters make notes, such as 
agreeing with the speaker or not. They do not know
the Polemic Language and are not programmers. 

They want to be able to edit the timeline with the
annotations. They are not musical or programmers but
do want to be able to use an interface to give the 
note a musical note.
